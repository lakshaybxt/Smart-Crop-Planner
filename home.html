		<div id="output">Delhi's Kharif season (July-October) is characterized by hot and humid weather with substantial rainfall.  Loamy soil, being a mix of sand, silt, and clay, offers good drainage and water retention, making it suitable for a variety of crops.  Here are some of the best crops to grow in Delhi with loamy soil during the Kharif season:

			* **Bajra (Pearl Millet):**  Bajra is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in hot, arid conditions.  It's well-suited to loamy soil and requires relatively less water, making it a resilient option even with erratic rainfall.
			
			* **Jowar (Sorghum):** Similar to Bajra, Jowar is another drought-resistant cereal crop that performs well in loamy soil and high temperatures. It's also relatively low maintenance.
			
			* **Maize (Corn):** Maize requires well-drained soil and plenty of sunshine, both readily available in Delhi during Kharif. Loamy soil provides the ideal balance of drainage and water retention for optimal growth.
			
			* **Cowpea (Lobia):**  A legume, cowpea is relatively less demanding in terms of soil fertility and tolerates moderate heat. It improves soil health through nitrogen fixation.  Loamy soil provides the right structure for its root system.
			
			* **Moth Bean (Matki):** Another legume, moth bean is drought-resistant and well-adapted to the warm and humid conditions of Delhi's Kharif season.  Its adaptability makes it a good choice even with less-than-perfect rainfall.
			
			
			**Why these are suitable:**  These crops are all relatively tolerant of the heat and potential variations in rainfall during Delhi's Kharif season.  Their adaptability to loamy soil, a common soil type in the region, reduces the risk of crop failure.  Moreover, they are relatively low maintenance and provide good yields under the prevailing climatic conditions.  Consider the specific microclimate of your location within Delhi and choose varieties suited to your specific conditions.
